	<li>Abstract: We study the symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) problem under arbitrary collusion and eavesdropping patterns for replicated databases. We find its capacity, which is the same as the capacity of the original SPIR problem with the number of servers N replaced by a number $ F^* $ . The number $ F^* $ is the optimal solution to a linear programming problem, and it is a function of the joint pattern, which is the union of the collusion and eavesdropping pattern. This is the first result that shows how two arbitrary patterns collectively affect the capacity of the SPIR problem. We draw the conclusion that for SPIR problems, the collusion and eavesdropping constraints are interchangeable in terms of capacity, i.e., the two patterns play the same role in the SPIR problem and the capacity remains unchanged if we exchange the colluding and eavesdropping patterns. As corollaries of our result, the capacity of the SPIR problem under arbitrary collusion patterns, and the capacity of the PIR problem where each colluding set is included in some eavesdropping set, are also found. Some extensions with restrictions to finite message lengths are provided, and in this case, upper and lower bounds on the capacity are given. The lower bound is described with a solution to an integer linear programming problem.</li>

	<li>Abstract: We formulate a new secure distributed computation problem, where a simulation center can require any linear combination of K workers' data through a caching layer consisted of <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> servers. The workers, servers and the simulation center do not trust each other. For workers, any worker’s data is required to be protected from up to <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> servers; for the server, any more information than the desired linear combination cannot be leaked; and for the simulation center, any single server know nothing about the coefﬁcients of the linear combination. Our goal is to ﬁnd the optimal download cost which is deﬁned as the size of message uploaded to the simulation center by the servers, to the size of desired linear combination. We proposed a scheme with the optimal download cost when <span class="math inline"><em>E</em> &lt; <em>N</em> − 1</span>. We also prove that when <span class="math inline"><em>E</em> ≥ <em>N</em> - 1</span>, the scheme is not feasible.</li>
